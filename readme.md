# Welcome to GitProj!
## Script created to save peoples lives from dealing with the montinous git directory creation

### This script will create a git directory, readme, and push to your git-repo with ONE command!
### Personalization is also provided by allowing you to define the readme message, or you can keep it general and stick with the generic message!

## Please download the script:
1. <b>move it into your ~/bin directory</b>
2. Add <b>export PATH=$PATH:/Users/user-name/bin</b> to your <b>.bash_profile</b> to ensure the path is set up
3. Lastly, ensure that the script has executable rights. If it does not, use <b>chmod u+x</b> to give your user rights

## Please share with your friends and enjoy your saved time:heart:!
